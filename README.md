I made some minor changes to the overall design of the page:
* I removed the menu button from the desktop version. The entire menu should be displayed in the header at the top, and if not, then it needs to be cut down and unimportant links can be moved to the footer.
* I made minor copy edits and giving credit for the quote.
* Creative license was taken with the mobile version and the mobile menu.
* I made the mobile header sticky to prevent the user from having to scroll all the way to the top again.
* I didn't have the "Stamp" logo so I replaced it with an open-source SVG (which I think looks better)
